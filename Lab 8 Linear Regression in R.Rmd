```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

salmon <- read_csv("salmon_imports.csv")
```

Make an Exploratory Scatterplot. If weâ€™re going to use linear regression, we should have reason to think that a linear relationship exists between
variables. So go ahead and look at the data (year on x-axis, imports on y-axis).

```{r}
salmon_scatt <- ggplot(salmon, aes(x = Year, y = salmon_fresh)) + 
  geom_point()

salmon_scatt
```

Overall, does it look like describing the relationship between
year and fresh salmon imports using linear regression makes sense? Do you have any concerns about using linear regression to describe the relationship?

- I think using a linear regression makes sense.
